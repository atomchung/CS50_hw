1. TODO  
Q.What’s stdint.h?
A. It defined the length of memory for each variavle

2.  TODO
Q. What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
A. To understand how many memory you are going to use for each data type. 

3.  TODO
Q.How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
A.BYTE: 8 bit / DWORD: 32 bit / LONG: 32 bit/ WORD: 16 bit.

4.  TODO
Q.What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? 
Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."
A. WORD

5.  TODO
Q.What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
A. bfSize is the size of the bmp file, which includes the headerfiles.
   biSize is the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER header file.

6.  TODO
Q.What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
A.If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB with the origin at the upper left corner.

7.  TODO
Q.What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
A.biBitCount

8.  TODO
Q.Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?
A.If computer is lack of memory, it might face problem to create new file.

9.  TODO
Q.Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
A.Read 1 bit each time.

10. TODO
Q.What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
A.3 

11. TODO
Q.What does fseek do?
A.fseek allows you to change the location of the file pointer.

12. TODO
